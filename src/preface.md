# Preface

These are lecture notes for the "Programming Languages I" course at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
These lecture notes have at some point started as a Scala version of a subset of
the excellent book "Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation" by Shriram Krishnamurthi, but
over the years they have been modified and extended considerably.

These lecture notes can be improved by your corrections, comments and amendments.
Every page of these lectures notes comes with a link to the corresponding document hosted on Github in the top right corner.
Please open a pull request for any changes that help us improve this script.
